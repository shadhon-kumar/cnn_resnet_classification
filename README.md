CNN vs ResNet: CIFAR-10 Multi-Class Classification

This project demonstrates the comparison of a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with a pre-trained ResNet model for multi-class classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The goal is to analyze the performance differences between these two architectures in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and computational efficiency.

Features

Custom CNN Architecture: Designed from scratch and optimized for the CIFAR-10 dataset.

Pre-trained ResNet: Fine-tuned ResNet model for image classification.

Comprehensive Metrics: Evaluates accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Visualization: Graphical representation of training loss, accuracy, and other metrics over epochs.

Dataset

CIFAR-10: A dataset of 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 classes (e.g., airplanes, cars, birds, cats, etc.).

Training set: 50,000 images.

Test set: 10,000 images.
